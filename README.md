This repository marks the first day of my 100 days of coding. 
The main objective was to create a .db file and feed it with external data.
In this case I used demographic data provided from government regarding the population of the cities from the state of Rio de Janeiro and the dengue epidemiological bulletin from each city.
All information remain as provided from the original sources, the only modification was in the format wich it was originally presented with the pourpouse to fit the csv manipulation criteria.
